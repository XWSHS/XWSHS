Hello World this is my first blog post today, <br>
so tommorow mothers day so i think i will be building somthing
interesting later. <br>
That being said i should probabb;y spend 2 minutes writing my
thoughts and then meditate on life.<br>
<br>
In the next week i aim to try to be more systematic and organized,
to do that I will probabbly put up a blog post outlining<br>
my goals for the coming weeks <br>
<br>
So later i plan to build somthing that integrates a puzzel and rize
which is a lottery number, it would be half funny and <br>
cool i could also add in music, and some funky stuff we will see...<br>
<br>
Anyways I was thinking , about school, well i hav a pseudo club and
there are just 2 people in it<br>
My partner in this crime ,is fustrating me however by not being
responsive on whatsapp, but we will see. <br>
I have reservations abt going more DIY then SB. <br>
<p>What does synthetic Biology mean to me ? Well i was first
inspired by the book Synthetic Aestheics which treated the field
like an Art. <br>
But then I loved how it related to molecular and Cellular Biology
, how the molecular underpinning were controlled by genes and
genes by the physical forces around them; Structural Biology.<br>
But then i liked microbiology long ago. How Microbes produce and
Process food, how they construct new chemicals and
Vitamins(Cofactors), Proteins and even carbohydrtaes how i was
facinated.And how i loved to colture diffrent microbes and see
them Grow!.<br>
But then alas I think now well the last year... it was not easy it
did not work out smoothly in retrospect. And well the goals were
in their naissence earnest, but uncompromised and unmeaningful.<br>
My lecturer said somthing meaningful about this project and i
intend to take her advice seriously. This project is not a project
in earnest but a serious attempt at upending Biology!<br>
Some of my focus has entered Bioinformatics how its accessible,
somtimes biological but nonetheless like a
ATGCGCCATGATGGAGTAGGTAAATTAGCCGGAGAATATCAGCTAGTGCATCAGGTGCGCCAATTGCATCAGCTAGGCCTAGGAGACAGAGTAGAGCGAGTGCGCCGTAGAGTAGT.<br>
Bioinforamatics is by some accounts joyless , but self-furfilling
and empowering . It allows me to simulate and do biology sitting
here amused at how a single untrained mind can do somthing
reserved for the Pros! Well what is the next step, it might just
be ingenuity!. We will see...<br>
</p>
In fact let me think it though now...Well nevermind i will go for a
jog and think this though cheers..

Clonal expansion -> 
Memory B cells -> activated in the first primary response
Epitopes -> One Antigen may  have multiple epitopes , can be reconized by diffrent antibodies

 Primary response , IgM
 Secondary Response IgG , IgA
 When a B cell that secretes IgM 
 IgE least abundent
 Bursa Fracticus, familarize
 Liver produces complement.
 When a B Cell recognizing antigen Z in the the primary Response , it can secrete IgG that binds to antigen Z during the secondary response.

    Lymphocytes express many Antigen Receptors or Antiodies on their Cell membrane. 
    B and T cells in the body are diverse producing many types of Antibodies in the cell, each antibody have Constant regions
    The constant regions are divided into Igs
    Recognition of epitopes is mediated by the immunoglobin folds
